# Unraveling the Secrets of Student Success 

Have you ever wondered what sets apart high-achieving students from those who struggle? Join us on a fascinating journey as we delve into the factors that influence student performance right here at Makerere University. Using the power of machine learning, we aim to predict students' academic success based on various factors such as their background, study habits, and even their social life.

## What We'll Do

- Data Wrangling: Dive into real student data, cleaning and preparing it for analysis.
- Feature Engineering: Uncover the key factors that truly impact grades.
- Model Building: Develop and train different prediction models to identify the most accurate one for forecasting student performance.
- Visualization: Present our findings through visually appealing graphs and charts for easy comprehension.
- Impact: Create a valuable resource that can assist students, lecturers, and the university in making informed decisions.

## Why This Matters

- For students: Gain insights into the factors that contribute to your success and identify areas where you may need additional support.
- For lecturers: Understand your students' needs better and tailor your teaching methods for maximum impact.
- For Makerere: Utilize data-driven decision-making to enhance the overall student experience.

## Tech Stack

- Language: Python 
- Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib (and others as required)
- Dataset: 
    - Primary Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository - [Student Performance Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance)
    - Ideally: We will explore Makerere-specific data to further enhance the project's relevance.

Let's embark on this exciting journey together and unlock the secrets of student success!
